# The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

# function polymorphism
# An example of a Python function that can be used on different objects is the len() function.

# string
# For strings len() returns the number of characters
string = "DilipGoud"
print(len(string))

# Tuple
# For tuples len() returns the number of items in the tuple:
tupple = ("Banana","Mango","Orange")
print (len(tupple))

 
# Dictionery
# For dictionery len() returns the number of items in the dictionery:

myDics = {
    "name":"Dilip",
    "age" : 22,
    "year" : 2002,
    "graduation" :2023
    }

print(len(myDics))
